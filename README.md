# EnderalMod

This mod is solely used just for the Enderal Modpack. I will be publishing Releases and Sub-Releases (Bugfixes, Etc.) in this Repository.

DISCLAIMER: I would not reccommend using this as a StandAlone mod as this is used to be able to create a Framework for some of the mechanics in the Enderal modpack.
